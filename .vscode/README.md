## PHP
 # Based on some youtube videos and documentations.
 - This tutorials have helped me to understand the basics of php and how to write the code.
 - syntax
 ```
    <?php
    Hello world!
    ?>
  
  ```
  - The script starts with <?php and ends with ?>.
  -These tags are also called ‘Canonical PHP tags’,Every PHP command ends  with a semi-colon (;).
  ## HTML Script Tags 
  -These are implemented using script tags. This syntax is removed in PHP 7.0.0.  So its no more used. 

     ```
     <script language="php">
         echo "hello world!";
     </script> 

     ```
